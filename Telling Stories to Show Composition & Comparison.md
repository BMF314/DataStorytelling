- **Creating a Pie Chart Using Datawrapper**
-   On its [homepage](https://www.datawrapper.de/), click to "Create a chart"
-   On the right top corner, you will find "New Chart"
-   Then, you see four steps of creating a chart: Upload Data, Check & Describe, Visualize, and Publish & Embed
    1.  Upload Data
        * You can copy & paste data table directly in the blank box;
        * Upload XLS or CSV files;
        * Import Google Spreadsheet by copying & pasting the link; or
        * Link to other external datasets.
        * **For our practice, we will use [Lehigh Enrollment data](https://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/profiles/profile.htm) from the Office of Institutional Research. I have put part of the 2017 data into this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFnkn8Sm_aJHxFLC6DD8W4mIthVDjTIz6A0h-_kE2lA/edit?usp=sharing). To create a chart, you can copy and paste the data into the box, or choose to import data directly from this Google Spreadsheet.**
        * If you copy & paste the data, make sure you select the portion of the dataset correctly
        * Once the data is correctly imported or added, hit "Proceed"
    2. Check & Describe
        * Check if your first row of data are labels
        * Sort the data if you want to make them show in a certain order (e.g., list data in descending order by the "Total" column)
        * Sometimes, you may need to transpose (swap rows and columns), add a column, etc.
    3. Visualize
        * Start with choosing the **chart type**. In this practice, we want to create a pie chart. You can choose which part (columns) of the data you want to visualize. In this practice, we want to visualize Total.
        * You can insert a title by typing into the text box. You can name it "Lehigh Enrollment 2017."
        * You can also change the chart size, either by directly typing in the length and the width, or by choosing the device on which your chart will be viewed.
        * The interface also allows you to do a colorblind check.
        * Next, we go to the "Refine" tab.
