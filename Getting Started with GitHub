## Getting Started with GitHub 
- **Creating Your Account on GitHub**
  -   Introduction to GitHub
  -   Show Inspect Source: right click on Macs -- Control click or touchpad tap
  -   Discuss difference between .md pages and html pages
  -   Register for and Set up GitHub.com. [Our Class GitHub.com Setup Instructions](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md)
  -   [Setting up GitHub: Hello, World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) with explanation of GitHub terms
  -   Or, more simply, Sign up for GitHub.com > Create new project/new repository > Initialize and create ReadMe (DataViz) page > Commit > begin to edit page
  -   Practice: [md Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
  -   [Another nice Markdown cheat sheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html)
  -   Practice: put name on ReadMe page in heading 2 and include link to Lehigh University
- **Create a GitHub portfolio site at github.io**
  - [Setting up GitHub hosting pages, github.io](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) This page was updated in 2017 and works well. If students have trouble, they can also see annotations at [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md).
  - Scroll down on that same [page guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) for instructions on **editing the code for themes**, such as **changing the page title**.
  - Remembering that the page eventually will be their GitHub portfolio, students should customize their pages in md language. Directions To Customize the GitHub.io Page can be found at our [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md). See GitHub portfolios from previous students for examples and inspiration.
  - To insert images (e.g., your profile picture) and/or links (e.g., links to your personal webpage, LinkedIn, social media pages, etc.), use markdown language as shown below. Note that you will need the url to the images (ending with jpeg, png, etc.) when inserting an image.

  - To further customize your GitHub page, see this [guide for customizing github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/).
